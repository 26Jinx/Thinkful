1. What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?
SELECT
	name,
	neighbourhood,
	room_type,
	price,
	availability_365
FROM
	sfo_listings
ORDER BY
	price DESC LIMIT 100
  
Full House Victorian: 7500 sqft, 4 floors, hot tub
Entire home
$10,000
Available 18/365 days?


2. What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?
SELECT 
	neighbourhood,
	SUM(number_of_reviews) as reviews,
	COUNT(id) as listings
FROM
	sfo_listings
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	reviews DESC LIMIT 10;
  
Mission has the most reviews which could mean that it is most popular since there needs to be 
at least that many rentals.
