1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
WITH
	rainy_days
AS (
	SELECT 
		DATE(date) AS rainy_day
	FROM
		weather
	WHERE
		events = 'Rain'
)
SELECT
	r.rainy_day,
	t.duration
FROM
	trips t
JOIN 
	rainy_days r
ON
	DATE(t.start_date) = r.rainy_day
ORDER BY
	2 DESC LIMIT 3;




2. Which station is full most often?
WITH
	docks_per_station
AS (
	SELECT
		station_id,
		name,
		dockcount
	FROM
		stations
)

SELECT
	d.station_id,
	d.name,
	COUNT(d.station_id)  as full
FROM
	status s
JOIN
	docks_per_station d
ON
	d.station_id = s.station_id
WHERE
	s.docks_available = 0
GROUP BY
	1, 2;





3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
SELECT
	s.station_id,
	s.name,
	s.dockcount,
	COUNT(t.start_station) AS trips_started
FROM
	stations s
JOIN
	trips t
ON
	t.start_station = s.name
GROUP BY
	1, 2, 3
ORDER BY
	s.dockcount DESC;
	
	
	

4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
WITH
	rainy_days
AS (
	SELECT
		date,
		events,
		zip
	FROM
		weather
	WHERE
		events = 'Rain'
	ORDER BY
		1
)

SELECT
	t.start_date as date,
	t.duration,
	t.zip_code as trip_zip,
	r.zip AS rain_zip
FROM
	trips t
JOIN
	rainy_days r
ON
	DATE(t.start_date) = DATE(r.date)
ORDER BY
	2 DESC LIMIT 1;
