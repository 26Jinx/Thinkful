We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model?

We are only dealing with one measurement, currency, we will not have to worry about normalizing. While we analyze the data, we might come across some trends in the amounts spent in each category or varying strength of correlation between one of the dependent variables and independent variable that could result in weighting the different categorical data points."
