    "First thing we need to do is determine whether the desired prediction is a type of classification or regression. Since we are trying to predict the times of sprinters, we will need to employ a regression model to predict our outcomes. If we are to take the times of races from the past 20 Olympics, this wouldn't necessarily be a very feature-rich dataset so the best algorithm might be to use the K-Nearest Neighbors. The only problem we might run into is that we won't be able to predict any record-breaking times.\n"

    "Having more features than rows means either that we have a very small sample or that we have a very large set of features. In either case, linear regression will be the best bet because if we have a very small sample we have a simple and fast model that resists overfitting but is susceptible to outliers, and if we have a very large dataset with numerous features, we can handle the feature set with regularization by using ridge and lasso."
